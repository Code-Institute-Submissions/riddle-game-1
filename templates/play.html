            <p>You are allowed two attempts to answer each riddle. You will get 
            one point for each one that you answer correctly. When you have 
            answered or attempted all 10, your score will be added to a leaderboard. 
            You will not be timed, so take as long as you need to answer. Good luck!</p>
